%% Description
% Construct the right-hand side vector for mode j.
%
%   R = RHS(Bound, Grid, Mode, Opt, StabRes, j)
%
%   Assembles the RHS from:
%     - Station 1: inflow shape function (phiIC), scaled by amplitude factor AF.
%     - Stations 2..nx: inhomogeneous wall/freestream boundary conditions (BCs)
%       from Bound.bcw/bct. Grid convention: index 1 = freestream (y=H), index
%       ny = wall (y=0). Freestream values injected only for IH_DR components
%       (Opt.bc_top).
%
%   Output: R [N x 1]: RHS vector for the global linear system ML * q = R.

%% Inputs
% Name    size         unit   explanation
% Bound   (1,1) struct [-]    boundary conditions and outflow-buffer coefficients
% Grid    (1,1) struct [-]    grid sizes, coordinates and inverse metric terms
% Mode    (1,1) struct [-]    mode bookkeeping: nf, active set RunJ and the interaction tables
% Opt     (1,1) struct [-]    solver options; see the option index in docs/user_guide.md
% StabRes (1,1) struct [-]    solution: shape functions, modal amplitudes, wavenumbers and iteration history
% j       (1,1)        [-]    mode counter of the mode the right-hand side is built for

%% Outputs
% Name size           unit   explanation
% R    (nvar*ny*nx,1) [-]    right-hand side: inflow shape at station 1, inhomogeneous wall and freestream conditions downstream

        % Same row map the LHS uses, so each channel's value lands on the row
        % whose BC type was consulted. The freestream and wall maps differ in the
        % compressible case (see bc_rows).
