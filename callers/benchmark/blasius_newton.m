%% Description
% DeHNSSo — Blasius K-type breakdown via Newton pseudo-arclength continuation
%  Continuation in the inflow amplitude from A0_fund = 2.40e-3 to 3.00e-3, on a
%  400 x 40 grid (R = 400-1067) at M=1. The Jacobian is 2N = 256k, so this runs
%  in minutes on a laptop. A direct solve at the target does not converge from a
%  cold start, which is why this is a continuation and not a single Newton solve.
%
%  Meant as a first Newton run and as a check that MUMPS is working. It is NOT a
%  benchmark: the grid is coarse and the domain short, so the amplitudes are not
%  converged. The full case (1050 x 60, M=2, Jacobian 2N = 1.512M) needs ~80 GB
%  and a workstation; see docs/DeHNSSo_guide.md for the sizing rule.
%
%  REFERENCE (this grid, these settings). If your run matches these, Newton and
%  MUMPS are working:
%      converged in 6 steps, 1 factorisation
%      max A(1,0) = 2.641824e-02
%      N-factor   = 2.175482
%  Took 4.0 min and ~8.6 GB on an M-series laptop. The step count and timing may
%  shift with a different MUMPS build; the two numbers should not.
%
%  MUMPS is required and is a separate dependency. If you have not built it, run
%  src/external/mumps_5.3.5/install/install_mumps.sh first, and start MATLAB with
%  OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 (see docs/DeHNSSo_guide.md, "Running it: MUMPS, memory and where").
